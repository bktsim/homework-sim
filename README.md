# Homework Simulator

Homework Simulator is a project that I have worked on with two other peers for 2 months during the summer of 2020. 

It is a classic clicker game with game progerssion, global leaderboards and microtransactions on ROBLOX, coded with Lua.

You can play the game here: https://www.roblox.com/games/5609136861/Homework-Simulator

This repository contains an exerpt of the code in the game for reference.
