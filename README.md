Homework Simulator is a project that I have worked on with two other peers for 2 months during the summer of 2020. 

It is a classic clicker game where players click to upgrade their books and progress through the game - until they reach the final level. The game is equipped with a progression system, global leaderboards, upgrades, shop and microtransactions, just like a real clicker game. 

It is hosted on ROBLOX, and all the code is written in Lua.

You can play the game here: https://www.roblox.com/games/5609136861/Homework-Simulator

This repository contains an exerpt of the code in the game for reference.
